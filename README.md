# Project--1
As Operations, I need a terraform script that will spin up a t2.medium instance in AWS us-east-1 that allows for port 22, 80, 443 and additional support for services installed.  

An elastic IP should be assigned to the instance. 

Additionally PostgreSQL needs to be installed on this vm.
